# Digital Engagement and Mental Health  
### Evidence from the 2024 General Social Survey (GSS)
This project was completed as part of an independent learning 

## Overview
This project examines the relationship between **digital engagement** and **mental health outcomes** among U.S. adults using data from the **2024 General Social Survey (GSS)**.

Rather than treating digital technology as inherently harmful or beneficial, this analysis evaluates whether digital engagement functions as a **mental health resource**—supporting access, skills, and coping—rather than as a direct driver of subjective happiness.

All analyses were conducted using **IBM SPSS Statistics (v31)**.

## Research Questions
1. How is digital engagement associated with the likelihood of having ever received a mental health diagnosis?
2. Is digital engagement related to general self-reported happiness?
3. Does the relationship persist after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors?

## Data
- **Source:** General Social Survey (GSS) 2024
- **Sample size:** 3,309 respondents
- **Modules used:** ISSP Digital Society, Mental Health, Core Demographics
- **Missing values:** Handled using GSS-standard negative codes (−100 to −70)

## Key Variables

### Digital Engagement Index (constructed)
A composite index created from:
- Frequency of internet use
- Self-rated internet skill
- Emotional reliance on internet access

### Mental Health Outcomes
- Ever diagnosed with a mental health problem (binary)
- Ever treated for a mental health problem (binary)
- General happiness (ordinal)

### Controls
- Age
- Sex
- Education
- Family income

## Methods
- Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis
- Pearson correlations
- Multiple linear regression (general happiness)
- Binary logistic regression (mental health diagnosis)
- Predicted probability visualization from logistic regression
---

## Key Findings

- **Digital engagement is significantly associated with lower odds of having ever received a mental health diagnosis**, even after controlling for age, sex, education, and income.
- **Digital engagement is not associated with general happiness**, suggesting that digital life may support mental health management without directly increasing subjective well-being.
- These results support a **resource-based interpretation** of digital engagement rather than simplistic “good vs bad” narratives.

---

## Visualization
The final visualization plots the **predicted probability of mental health diagnosis** across levels of digital engagement, holding demographic controls constant.
